I currently work at GSK as a Senior AI/ML Engineer where I split my time between individual contributor work and
managing a team of 3 engineers working on evaluation of LLMs and agent-based LLM-powered applications. Previously
I was an applied scientist in the recommender systems team at KidsLoop. Prior to joining KidsLoop, I was
doing my PhD at the University of Bristol, where I focused on weak supervision (noisy labels, partial annotations),
ML interpretability / explainability and behaviour modelling for healthcare. During my PhD I also spent time at Facebook working on Computer Vision and at AXA working on ML interpretability. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a MMast Mathematics (Part III) from the
University of Cambridge with a focus on statistics and a BEng Engineering Mathematics from the University of Bristol.
